I committed to doing this free-of-charge for two years, and starting in year three, the Teiger Foundation awarded a grant to continue this work. During this period, you were hired as the first Global Head of Environmental Sustainability of an international gallery. And over the last couple of years, we’ve communicated regularly on exhibition carbon emissions analysis. Understanding emissions and their impact is a crucial first step in organizational change. Can you share your journey to reduction? How have you gone about creating carbon budgets for exhibitions? And, for artists, curators or institutions, how can we better understand carbon emissions? ",

Initially, it felt like a big project scoping out what we wanted to calculate. What’s been most inspiring to see from the carbon calculations that we’ve done for shows in Somerset and Los Angeles to date, and then published through Artist’s Commit as Climate Impact Reports, is that our colleagues are interested, engaged and invested. Team members involved in planning the shows have been fundamental to gathering the information and using it in constructive ways in their individual roles.",
